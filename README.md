# Model-Development
Some questions we want to ask in this module

    Do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?
    Do I know if I put a fair value on my car?

In data analytics, we often use Model Development to help us predict future observations from the data we have.

A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.
